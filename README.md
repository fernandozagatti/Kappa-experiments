# Kappa-experiments

Experiment to identify which Kappa is good for your training dataset.

Four datasets, originally created for different types of tasks, were selected for our experiments: two of them using textual data and two using structured (attribute-value) data. All datasets are available for free use:

* [Electricity](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=151) 
* [Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=32)
* [ASSIN 2](https://sites.google.com/view/assin2/)
* [Mac-Morpho](http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/macmorpho/)

We performed our experiments following the stages: (1) Kappa calculation, (2) Synthetic annotation change, (3) Model building, and (4) Model evaluation.
